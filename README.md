# Title
Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze "customer churn patterns" across different subscription plans, understand factors driving churn, and provide insights to improve customer retention.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about customers’ subscriptions and service usage, including:
- Dataset collected from the Kaagle
- Contract Type**: Monthly, Yearly, 2-Year
- Additional Services : Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection.
- Tech Support Usage: Number of tech tickets
- Monthly Charges: Average price paid by customers
- Churners: Yes or No

## Insights
- Monthly customers drive the most churn, contributing 42.71% of total monthly subscribers—higher than yearly or 2-year plans.
- These customers have lower adoption of additional services compared to longer-term plans.
- Churners without tech support had an average of 1.07 tech tickets and an average monthly price of $76.56.
- Non-churners without support had fewer tickets (0.14) and a lower price ($73.18).
- Some churners with tech support still left due to high tech ticket usage (2.21) and higher monthly charges ($84.26).
- Non-churners with tech support had low ticket usage (0.18) and moderate pricing ($80.04)
- Monthly churners tend to pay higher prices, with an average monthly charge of $66.40.
- Overall, monthly customers may perceive poor support and network value, which, combined with higher charges, contributes to higher churn.
